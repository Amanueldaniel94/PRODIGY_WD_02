This is a simple yet interactive Stopwatch Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times. It also features a customizable background color and a circular stopwatch display.
This project was created as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech. It helped me enhance my JavaScript and UI design skills while working on a functional and interactive web application.
